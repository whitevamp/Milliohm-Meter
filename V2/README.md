PCB is available from OSH Park. A PCB (using surface mount components) designed by one of my subscribers<br>
“pbreviceps” (Greg Christenson). Greg has taken my design and produced a very high quality PCB (double sided) and<br>
made it freely available to purchase from OSH Park (3 blank PCB’s are supplied at a cost of US$19.5 plus shipping<br>
costs). Direct link: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/UWvehNO2<br>
